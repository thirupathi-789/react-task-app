        <h1 style={{ color: "blue" }}>Bananas</h1>
        <p>Bananas are a staple starch for many tropical populations. Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is isoamyl acetate (also known as banana oil), which, along with several other compounds such as butyl acetate and isobutyl acetate, is a significant contributor to banana flavor.</p>

        <h1 style={{ color: "blue" }}>Capsisum</h1>
        <p>Many varieties of the same species can be used in many different ways; for example, C. annual includes the "bell pepper" variety, which is sold in both its immature green state and its red, yellow or orange ripe state.

          This same species has other varieties as well, such as the Anaheim chilly often used for stuffing, the dried Ancho chilly used to make chili powder, the mild-to-hot Jalapeño, and the smoked ripe Jalapeño, known as a Chipotle.

          Most of the capsaicin in a pepper is found in the interior ribs that divide the chambers of the fruit, and to which the seeds are attached. At the stem end of the pod, glands secrete the capsaicin, which then spreads throughout, but is concentrated on the ribs and seeds. The amount varies very significantly by variety, and is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU), ranging from the mild bell pepper to the scorching Habanero chile.</p>

        <h1 style={{ color: "blue" }}>Cauliflower</h1>
        <p>Cauliflower heads can be roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or eaten raw. When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed, leaving only the florets (the edible "curd" or "head"). The leaves are also edible but are often discarded.[25]

          Cauliflower is a low-calorie, gluten-free alternative to rice and flour. Between 2012 and 2016, cauliflower production in the United States increased by 63%, and cauliflower-based product sales increased by 71% between 2017 and 2018. Cauliflower rice is made by pulsing cauliflower florets and cooking the result in oil.[26][27] Cauliflower pizza crust is made from cauliflower flour and is popular in pizza restaurants.[28] Mashed cauliflower is a low-carbohydrate alternative to mashed potatoes.</p>

        <h1 style={{ color: "blue" }}>Ginger</h1>
        <p>Ginger is a common spice used worldwide, whether for meals or as a folk medicine.[39] Ginger can be used for a variety of food items such as vegetables, candy, soda, pickles, and alcoholic beverages.[35]

          Ginger is a fragrant kitchen spice.[5] Young ginger rhizomes are juicy and fleshy with a mild taste. They are often pickled in vinegar or sherry as a snack or cooked as an ingredient in many dishes. They can be steeped in boiling water to make ginger herb tea, to which honey may be added. Ginger can be made into candy or ginger wine.</p>
